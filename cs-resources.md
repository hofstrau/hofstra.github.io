# Resources for Working Remotely

## VPN access

**[VPN access](https://cs.hofstra.edu/docs/pages/guides/vpn_intro.html) is required to access the University's network and select services from off campus.**<br>

**You must install a VPN client and connect to the CS VPN to remotely access the Big Data Lab.**

To request VPN access, please reach out to your area's technical liaison: Alex Rosenberg, Alexander.J.Rosenberg@hofstra.edu.

- Training materials specifically for Hofstra faculty are available at [https://www.hofstra.edu/about/it/it-remote-faculty.html](https://www.hofstra.edu/about/it/it-remote-faculty.html)
- A getting started guide for Zoom is available at [https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/categories/200101697](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/categories/200101697)

## Telephone (By Request)

Two options are available to receive calls from your Hofstra desk phone when you’re not on campus.

**Forward calls from your Hofstra desk phone to your cell phone:**
- "Set it and forget it" option for people who want to be able to answer calls to their Hofstra phone on their phone, and don’t mind making outbound calls from their cell number.
- Inbound calls to your Hofstra extension will ring to your cell phone at all times, until you disable forwarding.
- Outbound calls from your cell phone will show your cell phone number as the caller ID.

**Use Jabber softphone via VPN to access a full-featured copy of your Hofstra desk phone:**
- Option for people who need direct extension-to-extension dialing, and who want outbound calls to come from their Hofstra caller ID.
- Jabber app can be installed alongside the Hofstra VPN client on Windows, MacOS, iPhone, or Android.
- Inbound calls to your Hofstra extension will ring to your Jabber app, as long as the app is open and you are connected to VPN.
- Outbound calls made via Jabber will show your Hofstra caller ID.
- For best results, we recommend that you use a USB headset when you use Jabber on Windows or MacOS, but speakerphone is available if you don’t have a headset.

**Note:** If you normally answer calls from a call queue, you must use Jabber on Windows or MacOS. Forwarding and Jabber mobile apps will not work with call queues. This note applies to you if you normally log in to Cisco Finesse before calls ring to your Hofstra desk phone.

To request one of the above telephone services, please reach out to your area’s technical liaison: Alex Rosenberg, Alexander.J.Rosenberg@hofstra.edu. Chargebacks for these services are suspended at this time.
